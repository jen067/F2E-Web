                    <h3>FISHING NET</h3>
                    <p>Fishing nets are useful tools for fishermen to catch fish, allowing them to capture large quantities at once. However, during use, they can become damaged or lost. When this happens, the nets can be left behind in the ocean, contributing to the problem of marine debris.</p>
